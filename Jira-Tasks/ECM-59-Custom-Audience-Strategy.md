**Task Type:** Advanced Strategy - Warm Traffic
**Use When:** You have existing engaged audiences (Instagram, email, website)

---

## Overview

**YOUR ADVANTAGE:** You have Instagram followers who already know your brand.

**Expected Performance:**
- Custom Audience ROAS: 5-7x (vs 2.5-3.5x cold)
- Custom Audience CAC: $30-50 (vs $80-120 cold)
- Custom Audience CTR: 2.5-4% (vs 1-1.5% cold)
- **2x better performance across all metrics**

## Campaign Structure

**Campaign 1: Warm Traffic ($100/day)**
- Ad Set 1: Instagram Engagers - $50/day
- Ad Set 2: Lookalike 1% - $50/day

**Campaign 2: Cold Traffic ($100/day)**

**Campaign 3: Retargeting ($50/day)**
- Website visitors

**Total: $250/day**

## How to Find Your Instagram Audience

1. Meta Ads Manager → Audiences
2. Look for: "Instagram Engagers" or "IG Followers"
3. If not found: Create new Custom Audience
   - Type: Instagram Account
   - Engagement: People who engaged with posts (365d)

## Create Lookalike Audiences

**Lookalike = Meta finds "twins" of your followers**

1. Audiences → Create Lookalike
2. Source: Instagram Engagers
3. Location: Canada
4. Size: 1% (top 1% most similar = ~300K people)
5. Expected ROAS: 4-5x

## Custom Audience Ad Copy

**DIFFERENT messaging than cold traffic:**

"Hey Instagram fam! 👋 You've been following our journey—now's the perfect time to experience EcoComfort for yourself..."

- Shorter copy (they know you)
