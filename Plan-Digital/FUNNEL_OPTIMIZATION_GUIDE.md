# CUSTOMER ACQUISITION FUNNEL MAP & OPTIMIZATION CHECKLIST

**Use this to diagnose where customers are dropping off and how to fix it**

---

# DIGITAL MARKETING ENHANCEMENTS 🔁

- **Journey Lens:** Pair each funnel stage with a *mission* (Discover, Evaluate, Commit, Advocate) and map at least one hero content asset, one paid asset, and one automation per persona.
- **Content Clustering:** Use the book’s *Hub → Spoke* approach—anchor every paid offer to a high-value hub page (Holiday Gift Guide, Cooling Sleep Science, Boxing Day Deals) with 3-4 supporting blog or video spokes that collect leads.
- **Experience Boosters:** Layer social proof and micro-conversions (quiz, download, SMS reminder) before pushing a purchase CTA; this raises engagement scores and feeds first-party data to Klaviyo.
- **Measurement Stack:** Track *Attention (CTR)*, *Interest (Scroll depth)*, *Desire (ATC rate)*, *Action (Checkout CR)*, and *Advocacy (referral rate)* weekly inside the KPI dashboard so optimization projects stay balanced.

Use this lens whenever you run the diagnostic checklists below.

# STAGE-BY-STAGE OPTIMIZATION

## STAGE 1: AWARENESS → CLICK (Ad Performance)

### METRIC TO TRACK: CTR (Click-Through Rate)

**Formula:** (Clicks ÷ Impressions) × 100

**Target:** 2%+

**If CTR < 1% → Your ad creative is broken**

### DIAGNOSTIC CHECKLIST

**If CTR is low, check:**

□ **Image Quality**
- [ ] Is it high resolution? (1080x1080 minimum)
- [ ] Does it show the product clearly?
- [ ] Is there a human element? (person using product)
- [ ] Does it stop the scroll? (visually interesting)

□ **Copy Hook**
- [ ] Does first line grab attention?
- [ ] Is there a question or bold claim?
- [ ] Does it address a pain point?
- [ ] Is it about them, not you?

**Examples:**
❌ "Check out our natural duvets" (boring)
✅ "Stop waking up hot and sweaty every night" (pain point)

□ **Offer Clarity**
- [ ] Is the offer clear in first 3 lines?
- [ ] Is there urgency? (deadline, limited time)
- [ ] Is there a specific number? ($138 free, not "free gift")

□ **Targeting**
- [ ] Are you targeting gift buyers (35-65)?
- [ ] Is location set to Canada only?
- [ ] Are interests relevant? (wellness, organic, sleep)

### FIXES FOR LOW CTR

**Quick wins:**
1. **Change the image** (most important)
   - Use lifestyle photo (person sleeping)
   - Add text overlay: "FREE $138 Pillow Set"
   - Show gift-wrapped product

2. **Rewrite first 2 lines**
   - Start with question: "Still looking for the perfect Christmas gift?"
   - Or bold claim: "73% of duvets contain these 5 chemicals"

3. **Add specific numbers**
   - "Free $138 pillow" not "free gift"
   - "$274.99" not "affordable"
   - "Order by Dec 20" not "order soon"

4. **Test different audiences**
   - Try 45-65 (older gift buyers with more money)
   - Add interest: "Luxury goods"

---

## STAGE 2: CLICK → ADD TO CART (Landing Page)

### METRIC TO TRACK: Add-to-Cart Rate

**Formula:** (Add to Carts ÷ Landing Page Views) × 100

**Target:** 3-5%

# FUNNEL LEAK DETECTOR

**Use this to find where you're losing people:**

## Current State Analysis

**Step 1: Calculate each stage**

```
Ad Impressions: 10,000
↓ CTR: 2% (200 clicks)
Landing Page Views: 200
↓ ATC Rate: 3% (6 add to cart)
Cart Sessions: 6
↓ Checkout Rate: 50% (3 purchases)
Purchases: 3

CONVERSION RATE: 3 ÷ 10,000 = 0.03%
```

**Step 2: Find the weakest link**

| Stage | Your % | Benchmark | Gap | Priority |
|-------|--------|-----------|-----|----------|
| CTR | 2% | 2% | ✅ Good | Low |
| ATC | 3% | 4% | 🟡 -1% | Medium |
| Checkout | 50% | 60% | 🟡 -10% | High |

**Step 3: Fix the biggest gap first**

In this example: Checkout conversion is 10% below benchmark
→ Focus on reducing cart abandonment
→ Add free shipping, trust badges, exit popup

# CONVERSION RATE CALCULATOR

**Use this to project results:**

```
If you have:
- 10,000 ad impressions
- 2% CTR = 200 clicks
- 4% ATC rate = 8 carts
- 50% checkout = 4 purchases
- $280 AOV = $1,120 revenue

Ad spend: $200 (at $20 CPM)
ROAS: $1,120 / $200 = 5.6x ✅

Now improve ONE metric:

If you increase ATC from 4% to 5%:
- 10,000 impressions
- 2% CTR = 200 clicks
- 5% ATC rate = 10 carts ← +2 carts
- 50% checkout = 5 purchases ← +1 purchase
- $280 AOV = $1,400 revenue ← +$280

New ROAS: $1,400 / $200 = 7.0x ✅

That 1% improvement = 25% more revenue
```

**Takeaway:** Small improvements compound

---

**Focus on fixing the biggest leak in your funnel first**  
**Then move to the next**  
**Track everything**  
**Test one variable at a time**  
**Let data guide decisions, not guesses**
