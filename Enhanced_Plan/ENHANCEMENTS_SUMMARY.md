### 6. Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) Framework

**Original Approach:** Basic A/B testing mentioned (creative, headline, discount)

**Enhanced Approach:** Systematic CRO cycle with hypothesis-driven testing

#### THE CRO CYCLE (8 Steps)

**Step 1: Identify Goals**
- Immediate goals (clicks, form completions)
- Campaign goals (leads generated, purchases)
- Long-term goals (LTV, AOV, retention rate)

**Step 2: Gather Data**
- Site metrics (Google Analytics)
- User behavior (heatmaps, session recordings)
- Customer feedback (surveys, support tickets)

**Step 3: Analyze Data**
- What's the conversion rate? (Is it acceptable?)
- What's hurting conversion? (Friction points)
- Where are users dropping off?

**Step 4: Develop Hypotheses**
- Format: "We believe that doing [CHANGE] for [AUDIENCE] will make [OUTCOME] happen"
- Example: "We believe that adding customer photos to the product page for first-time visitors will increase Add-to-Cart rate by 15%"

**Step 5: Design Variants**
- Create test versions based on hypotheses
- Prioritize high-impact, low-effort tests first
- One variable per test (isolate learnings)

**Step 6: Implement Testing Technology**
- Set up tools (VWO, Google Optimize)
- Define conversion events
- Set traffic split (50/50)

**Step 7: Run Test**
- Run until statistical significance (95% confidence)
- Duration depends on traffic (see chart below)
- Don't stop early (false positives)

**Step 8: Analyze Results**

- Why or why not?
- What did we learn?
- What to test next?

**Week 6: Retargeting Tests**

**Statistical Significance Chart:**

| Daily Conversions | 2 Variants | 3 Variants | 4 Variants |
|-------------------|------------|------------|------------|
| 10/day            | 16 days    | 23 days    | 30 days    |

#### HYPOTHESIS TESTING METHODOLOGY

**When to Use Hypothesis Testing:**

Scenario: "Our Add-to-Cart rate is lower than expected"

**Step 1: Review Key Metrics**
- Current ATC rate: 2.5%
- Industry benchmark: 3.5-4%
- Gap: 1-1.5 percentage points

**Step 2: Generate Hypotheses (5-7 options)**

1. Product images are low quality → shoppers don't trust product
2. Price is higher than competitors → perceived as expensive
3. Shipping cost revealed too late → sticker shock at checkout
4. Product descriptions are unclear → shoppers don't understand benefits
5. Mobile experience is poor → mobile shoppers can't easily add to cart
6. Trust signals missing → shoppers concerned about legitimacy
7. Too many product options → choice paralysis

**Step 3: Use Drill-Down Metrics to Test**

- Check heatmaps: Are users clicking on images to zoom?
- Check device breakdown: Is mobile ATC rate lower than desktop?
- Check exit pages: Where do users leave product page?
- Check scroll depth: Do users scroll to see full description?
- Check cart analysis: Do users add multiple items or just one?

**Step 4: Prioritize Hypotheses**

Based on data:
- Hypothesis #5 (mobile experience) = MOST LIKELY (mobile ATC is 1.8% vs. desktop 3.2%)
- Hypothesis #3 (shipping cost) = SECOND (high cart abandonment at shipping step)
- Hypothesis #1 (image quality) = THIRD (low zoom click rate)

**Step 5: Design Tests**

- Test A: Redesign mobile product page (larger images, sticky ATC button)
- Test B: Add "Free Shipping Over $150" message to product page
- Test C: Add 360° product images

**Step 6: Implement & Monitor**

- Run Test A first (highest priority)
- If Test A improves ATC to 3.5%+, implement site-wide
- If Test A fails, run Test B

**Step 7: Document Learnings**

- Create "Test Database" with all hypotheses, tests, results
- Tag insights for future reference
- Share learnings with team

**Impact:** Data-driven decisions reduce guesswork, 50%+ faster problem-solving

### 8. Psychological Triggers (Cialdini's 6 Principles)

**Original Approach:** Some urgency mechanisms (countdown timers, shipping deadlines)

**Enhanced Approach:** Systematic integration of all 6 persuasion principles

#### PRINCIPLE 1: RECIPROCITY
*"People feel obligated to give back to others who have given to them"*

**Applications:**
- Give valuable content before asking for sale (blog posts, guides, quiz)
- Free lead magnet (duvet buying guide) before purchase ask
- Free shipping threshold creates gift feeling
- Email welcome series provides value before first offer
- Free samples at events (if applicable)

**Copy Examples:**
- "We've created a comprehensive guide to help you choose the perfect duvet. No strings attached—just want to help you sleep better."
- "Here's $20 off as a thank you for joining our email list"

**Impact:** 18-25% increase in conversion after value-first interactions

---

#### PRINCIPLE 2: COMMITMENT & CONSISTENCY
*"People want to be consistent with things they have said or done"*

**Applications:**
- Start with small asks (email signup) before big asks (purchase)
- Quiz/survey gets micro-commitments ("Yes, I have sleep issues")
- Cart addition is commitment → use in abandoned cart emails
- Public commitments (social media posts, reviews) increase loyalty
- Progress indicators in checkout ("You're 50% done!")

**Copy Examples:**
- "You said sleep quality was important to you. That's why we created..."
- "You've already taken the first step by joining our community. Now complete your journey to better sleep."

**Abandoned Cart Email:**
- "You were so close to better sleep! Complete your order now."

**Impact:** 15-20% improvement in cart completion with commitment language

---

**Trust Page Elements:**

**Impact:** 20-30% trust increase, 15% conversion improvement

- Relatable messaging (we've all had bad sleep)
- Attractive brand aesthetic (calming, natural, premium)
- Friendly, helpful customer service tone
- Personal emails (from founder, not "Marketing Team")

- Sign emails with real names and photos

**Email From Lines:**

**Brand Voice:**

#### PRINCIPLE 6: SCARCITY
*"People want more of what is less available"*

**Applications:**
- Shipping deadline scarcity ("Order by Dec 20 for Christmas delivery")
- Limited-time offers ("40% off ends Sunday at midnight")
- Stock counters ("Only 7 left in stock")
- Seasonal availability ("Holiday gift sets available until Dec 25 only")
- Countdown timers on sales
- "Limited quantity" messaging
- Early-bird pricing
- VIP/exclusive access
- One-time offers in email

**Copy Examples:**
- "🚨 Order by Dec 20 or risk not arriving by Christmas"
- "⏰ Flash Sale ends in 6 hours"
- "Only 3 Queen-size duvets left at this price"
- "This gift set won't be available after the holiday season"

**Urgency Mechanisms:**
- Email: "Last day for 40% off"
- Landing page: Countdown timer to shipping deadline
- Product page: Low stock alerts
- Checkout: "This price is locked for 15 minutes"

**Important:** Use genuine scarcity only (don't fabricate false urgency)

**Impact:** 25-35% conversion lift during scarcity periods
