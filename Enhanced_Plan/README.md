## ❓ FAQs

### Q: Do I need to implement EVERYTHING in the enhancements?

### Q: Which enhancements will have the biggest impact?
**A:** Top 3 highest-impact, easiest-to-implement:
1. **Customer personas + tailored messaging** (+25-40% conversion)

3. **Cialdini psychological triggers** (+30-40% conversion with social proof)
