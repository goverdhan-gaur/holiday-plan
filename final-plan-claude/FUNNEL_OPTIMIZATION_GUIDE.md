# CUSTOMER VALUE JOURNEY FUNNEL MAPPING

**8 stages to maximize customer lifetime value:**

| Stage | Funnel Transition | Key Tactic | Impact |
|-------|-------------------|------------|--------|
| **1-2: Awareness/Engagement** | Ad → Click → Visit | Educational ads, blog posts, sleep guides | Build awareness + provide value |
| **3: Subscribe** | Visit → Email Capture | Lead magnets (duvet guide, quiz), exit popups | Capture for nurturing |
| **4: Convert** | Email → Add to Cart → Purchase | Abandoned cart emails, urgency, social proof | First purchase |
| **5: Excite** | Purchase → Value Delivery | 6-email onboarding, setup guides, check-ins | Ensure satisfaction |
| **6: Ascend** | Cross-Sell/Upsell | Thank-you page upsells, day-14 cross-sell email | Increase AOV/LTV |
| **7: Advocate** | Review Requests | Day-30 review request (20% off incentive) | Generate social proof |
| **8: Promote** | Referrals | Day-60 referral ($20 give, $20 get) | Low-CAC acquisition |

**Key Insight:** Most campaigns stop at stage 4. Stages 5-8 increase LTV 40-60% and reduce future CAC.

# TRAFFIC TEMPERATURE OPTIMIZATION

**Segment by awareness level for better ROAS:**

| Temperature | Definition | Budget | Goal | Offers | Messaging | Success Metrics |
|-------------|------------|--------|------|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| **COLD** | Never heard of brand | 60% ($100-120/day) | Awareness + pixel | Blog posts, quiz, education | Problem-focused, NO hard sell | <$2 per view, 45s+ time on page |
| **WARM** | Visited/browsed, no purchase | 30% ($50-60/day) | Lead gen, conversions | Lead magnets, flash sales, $20 off | Solution-focused, social proof | 5-7% lead conversion, <$15 CAC |
| **HOT** | Past customers, cart abandoners | 10% ($20-30/day) | Repeat, upsells | Exclusive bundles, VIP access | Direct, personalized | 20%+ cart recovery, $400+ LTV |

**Ad Examples by Temperature:**
- **COLD:** "3 Reasons You Wake Up Sweaty" → Blog | "Quiz: What's Your Sleep Personality?"
- **WARM:** "You viewed our duvet—here's $20 off" | "★★★★★ 4.8/5 from 2,847 Canadians"
- **HOT:** "Complete your order (cart expires soon)" | "Exclusive: Early access to Boxing Day sale"

**Implementation:** Create 3 Meta campaigns with custom audiences (cold=lookalike, warm=website visitors, hot=purchasers/cart abandoners).

---

# CRO TESTING FRAMEWORK (8-Step Cycle)

**Systematic hypothesis-driven optimization:**

1. **Identify Goals** - Immediate (clicks, ATC), Campaign (purchases, ROAS), Long-term (LTV, retention)
2. **Gather Data** - Google Analytics, heatmaps (Hotjar), customer feedback
3. **Analyze Data** - Find conversion rate, drop-off points, friction
4. **Develop Hypotheses** - Format: "We believe [CHANGE] for [AUDIENCE] will make [OUTCOME] happen"
   - Example: "Adding customer photo reviews for first-time visitors will increase ATC 15%"
5. **Design Variants** - One variable per test, prioritize high impact + low effort first
6. **Implement Tool** - Google Optimize/VWO, define conversion event, 50/50 traffic split
7. **Run Test** - Until 95% statistical significance (see duration chart below)
8. **Analyze Results** - Did hypothesis prove true? Document learnings, decide next test

**Test Duration (to 95% confidence):**

| Daily Conversions | 2 Variants | 3 Variants |
|-------------------|------------|------------|
| 10/day            | 16 days    | 23 days    |
| 25/day            | 7 days     | 10 days    |
| 50/day            | 4 days     | 6 days     |

**Impact:** 3-5% weekly compound improvement = 20-30% total lift over 6 weeks

# STAGE-BY-STAGE OPTIMIZATION

## STAGE 1: AWARENESS → CLICK (Ad Performance)

### METRIC TO TRACK: CTR (Click-Through Rate)

**Formula:** (Clicks ÷ Impressions) × 100

**Target:** 2%+

**If CTR < 1% → Your ad creative is broken**

### DIAGNOSTIC CHECKLIST

**If CTR is low, check:**

□ **Image Quality**
- [ ] Is it high resolution? (1080x1080 minimum)
- [ ] Does it show the product clearly?
- [ ] Is there a human element? (person using product)
- [ ] Does it stop the scroll? (visually interesting)

□ **Copy Hook**
- [ ] Does first line grab attention?
- [ ] Is there a question or bold claim?
- [ ] Does it address a pain point?
- [ ] Is it about them, not you?

**Examples:**
❌ "Check out our natural duvets" (boring)
✅ "Stop waking up hot and sweaty every night" (pain point)

□ **Offer Clarity**
- [ ] Is the offer clear in first 3 lines?
- [ ] Is there urgency? (deadline, limited time)
- [ ] Is there a specific number? ($138 free, not "free gift")

□ **Targeting**
- [ ] Are you targeting gift buyers (35-65)?
- [ ] Is location set to Canada only?
- [ ] Are interests relevant? (wellness, organic, sleep)

### FIXES FOR LOW CTR

**Quick wins:**
1. **Change the image** (most important)
   - Use lifestyle photo (person sleeping)
   - Add text overlay: "FREE $138 Pillow Set"
   - Show gift-wrapped product

2. **Rewrite first 2 lines**
   - Start with question: "Still looking for the perfect Christmas gift?"
   - Or bold claim: "73% of duvets contain these 5 chemicals"

3. **Add specific numbers**
   - "Free $138 pillow" not "free gift"
   - "$274.99" not "affordable"
   - "Order by Dec 20" not "order soon"

4. **Test different audiences**
   - Try 45-65 (older gift buyers with more money)
   - Add interest: "Luxury goods"

**ENHANCEMENT:** Apply Cialdini principles
- **Social Proof:** "Join 2,847 Canadians sleeping better"
- **Scarcity:** "Order by Dec 20 for Christmas delivery"
- **Authority:** "OEKO-TEX Certified, Made in Canada"

---

### METRIC TO TRACK: Add-to-Cart Rate

**Formula:** (Add to Carts ÷ Landing Page Views) × 100

# FUNNEL LEAK DETECTOR

**Use this to find where you're losing people:**

## Current State Analysis

**Step 1: Calculate each stage**

```
Ad Impressions: 10,000
↓ CTR: 2% (200 clicks)
Landing Page Views: 200
↓ ATC Rate: 3% (6 add to cart)
Cart Sessions: 6
↓ Checkout Rate: 50% (3 purchases)
Purchases: 3

CONVERSION RATE: 3 ÷ 10,000 = 0.03%
```

**Step 2: Find the weakest link**

| Stage | Your % | Benchmark | Gap | Priority |
|-------|--------|-----------|-----|----------|
| CTR | 2% | 2% | ✅ Good | Low |
| ATC | 3% | 4% | 🟡 -1% | Medium |
| Checkout | 50% | 60% | 🟡 -10% | High |

**Step 3: Fix the biggest gap first**

In this example: Checkout conversion is 10% below benchmark
→ Focus on reducing cart abandonment
→ Add free shipping, trust badges, exit popup

**ENHANCEMENT:** Apply CRO Framework
1. Hypothesis: "We believe adding free shipping will reduce cart abandonment by 20%"
2. Design variant: Add "FREE SHIPPING" badge to checkout
3. Run A/B test for 7 days (or until statistical significance)
4. Analyze: Did abandonment improve? Document learning

# CONVERSION RATE CALCULATOR

**Use this to project results:**

```
If you have:
- 10,000 ad impressions
- 2% CTR = 200 clicks
- 4% ATC rate = 8 carts
- 50% checkout = 4 purchases
- $280 AOV = $1,120 revenue

Ad spend: $200 (at $20 CPM)
ROAS: $1,120 / $200 = 5.6x ✅

Now improve ONE metric:

If you increase ATC from 4% to 5%:
- 10,000 impressions
- 2% CTR = 200 clicks
- 5% ATC rate = 10 carts ← +2 carts
- 50% checkout = 5 purchases ← +1 purchase
- $280 AOV = $1,400 revenue ← +$280

New ROAS: $1,400 / $200 = 7.0x ✅

That 1% improvement = 25% more revenue
```

**Takeaway:** Small improvements compound

**ENHANCEMENT:** Model impact of full Customer Value Journey

```
ORIGINAL (Conversion only):
- 4 purchases
- $280 AOV
- $1,120 revenue
- ONE-TIME value

ENHANCED (CVJ Stages 5-8):
- 4 purchases
- $280 initial AOV
- $1,120 initial revenue
+ Day 14 cross-sell (18% conversion): 0.7 purchases × $150 = $105
+ Day 90 repeat purchase (20% rate): 0.8 purchases × $280 = $224
+ Day 60 referral (15% participate, 1 new customer): 0.15 × $280 = $42
TOTAL: $1,491 (+33% with retention stages)

LTV per customer: $373 (vs. $280 without CVJ stages)
```
