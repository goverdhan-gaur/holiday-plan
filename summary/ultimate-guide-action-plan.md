# Ultimate Guide to Digital Marketing — Action Plan

Use this sequential checklist to operationalize the book’s framework across a real business. Each step maps to the Customer Value Journey (CVJ) and specifies concrete deliverables, owners, and success indicators.

## Step 1: Align on Mission, Offers, and Metrics
- **Actions:** Document revenue target, profit goal, signature offers, and capacity constraints. List the KPIs that define success (ROAS, CPA, LTV, AOV).
- **Deliverables:** One-page growth brief; baseline analytics snapshot.
- **Owner:** Leadership + Finance.

## Step 2: Map the Customer Value Journey
- **Actions:** Workshop the eight CVJ stages (Aware → Promote) for your primary offer. Identify current touchpoints, friction, and gaps. Assign a health score (Red/Yellow/Green) to each stage.
- **Deliverables:** CVJ worksheet with stage-specific CTAs and traffic sources.
- **Owner:** Marketing Strategy.

## Step 3: Build/Refresh Customer Avatars
- **Actions:** Interview at least five customers per segment, mine CRM notes, and collect VOC from reviews/social. Capture Jobs-To-Be-Done, objections, favorite channels, and dream outcomes.
- **Deliverables:** Avatar dossiers linked to funnel stages.
- **Owner:** Research + Customer Success.

## Step 4: Plan Full-Funnel Content
- **Actions:** Audit existing assets against TOFU/MOFU/BOFU needs. Use the Content Campaign Plan to outline new topics, formats, channels, and ascension CTAs for the next 90 days.
- **Deliverables:** Content calendar with publish dates, owners, and repurposing notes.
- **Owner:** Content/Editorial Lead.

## Step 5: Engineer Traffic Campaigns
- **Actions:** For each priority offer, create an Ad Grid: list avatars, brainstorm hooks (Have, Feel, Status, Proof, Speed, Average Day), and write unique copy per cell. Assign budgets by traffic temperature (cold, warm, hot).
- **Deliverables:** Media plan with targeting, creative specs, test cadence, and budget pacing sheet.
- **Owner:** Paid Media Manager.

## Step 6: Stand Up Social Success Cycle
- **Actions:** Schedule daily listening rituals (alerts, saved searches). Define weekly influence content themes, networking/outreach targets, and social selling plays. Build topic maps to keep posts “on brand.”
- **Deliverables:** Social playbook with listening SOP, content matrix, outreach list, and KPI dashboard.
- **Owner:** Social + Community team.

## Step 7: Deploy Email Automation
- **Actions:** Storyboard and build the five core campaigns—Indoctrination, Engagement, Ascension, Segmentation, Re-engagement. Tag each automation with its CVJ stage and set trigger logic, delays, and suppression rules.
- **Deliverables:** Flow diagrams, copy decks, ESP automations, and a send calendar.
- **Owner:** Lifecycle/CRM Manager.

## Step 8: Fortify Search & Content Experience
- **Actions:** Run a technical SEO audit (crawl errors, speed, schema). Prioritize keywords by intent, write 10x content briefs, and publish/support pages with internal links, media, and CTA blocks.
- **Deliverables:** SEO issue log, keyword map, and brief library.
- **Owner:** SEO Specialist + Dev.

## Step 9: Instrument Analytics & Dashboards
- **Actions:** Define questions each team must answer weekly. Configure tracking (UTMs, conversions, events), hook up BI dashboards, and set review cadences (daily pulse, weekly performance, monthly retro).
- **Deliverables:** Metrics flowchart, dashboard links, and meeting agenda templates.
- **Owner:** Marketing Ops/Analytics.

## Step 10: Launch CRO & Testing Loop
- **Actions:** Prioritize pages by traffic and revenue impact. Collect data (heatmaps, session recordings, surveys), form hypotheses (“If…then…because”), design variants, and run split tests. Log every experiment with results and next actions.
- **Deliverables:** CRO backlog, active test tracker, and post-test insight library.
- **Owner:** Optimization Lead + UX.

## Step 11: Run Weekly CVJ Sync
- **Actions:** Review each CVJ stage’s health, highlight wins/blockers, and assign next experiments. Ensure learnings from traffic, email, social, and CRO feed the shared backlog.
- **Deliverables:** 30-minute agenda, decision log, and updated backlog.
- **Owner:** Growth Lead facilitating all channel owners.

## Step 12: Scale What Works
- **Actions:** When campaigns hit target KPIs (ROAS, CAC, opt-in rate), duplicate the winning Ad Grid cells into new audiences, repurpose high-performing content, and expand offers (bundles, continuity).
- **Deliverables:** Scale roadmap with incremental budget steps and resource requirements.
- **Owner:** Leadership + Channel owners.

Follow these steps sequentially, then loop back to Step 2 quarterly to reassess avatars, offers, and CVJ stage performance. Continuous iteration keeps the system compounding.
