## WHY THIS MATTERS:

### Without This Tracker:
❌ Run 4 ads, see overall 3.2x ROAS, scale all equally
❌ Waste money on losing ads
❌ Can't identify which angle/persona works

### With This Tracker:
✅ See Free Pillows: 4.8x ROAS (WINNER)
✅ See Temperature: 1.4x ROAS (LOSER)
✅ Pause losers, scale winners
✅ Same budget, 40% higher ROAS

---

## TOMORROW'S WORKFLOW:

**When Creating Ads (9 AM):**
1. Open Tab 6: "Ad Testing"
2. Find your ad row (e.g., Row 2: Free Pillows)
3. Use Column G as Meta campaign name
4. Use Column E in UTM: `utm_campaign=W1_FreePillows_GiftGiver`

**Daily Performance Check (6 PM):**
1. Meta Ads Manager → Export data
2. Tab 3: Add campaigns with Variable ID
3. Analyze: Which Variable ID = highest ROAS?
4. Scale: +20-30% on winners, pause losers
